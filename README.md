# Amazon_Vine_Analysis

## Overview
The purpose of this exercise was to breakdown a large data set into palatable chunks for analysis.

## Results

- There were 90 vine reviews and 37,385 non-vine reviews

- There were 44 5 star vine reviews and 14626 5 star non-vine reviews

- 49 percent (rounding) of the vine reviews had 5 stars. Whereas, of the non-vine reviews were only 39 percent were 5 stars.


## Summary

There seems to be a bias between paid reviews and non-paid reviews as evidenced by the ten percent difference in the likelyhood between recieveing a 5 star review.
To further test this bias we could produce star-rating averages for paid and non-paid and compare them.
